OpenLemmy is an implementation of the upstream [LemmyNet](https://github.com/LemmyNet/) project.

The purpose of this project is to create an easy to use containerized distribution of Lemmy. Easy deployment and customization for any Lemmy instance is our goal. Developer documentation and onboarding will be the starting focus of this project.
